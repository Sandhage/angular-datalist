# AngularDatalist

The purpose of this project is to build an angular dropdown component that behaves like an HTML5 datalist which is also compatible with Safari and iOS browsers.

I have built a similar component for a company that I work for, however the specific code used (as well as data models it required) are under IP. I am rebuilding this to be more generic and utilizing a slightly different approach leveraging services to mock-up and manage the items/data.

Here are some screen shot previews of how it works on the platform from my current company, Relay Network:
